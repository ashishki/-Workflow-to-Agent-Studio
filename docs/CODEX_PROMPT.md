# CODEX_PROMPT.md

Version: 2.0
Date: 2026-06-01
Phase: 14

This file is the compact implementation-session state. It should stay short. Completed V1 history is archived at `docs/archive/CODEX_PROMPT_V1_T01_T20_COMPLETE.md`.

Execution policy: continue the Codex-only loop until blocked, all active tasks are complete, or human input is required by `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT.md`.

## Current State

- Current phase: Phase 14 - SMB AI Roadmap Product Layer
- Next task: T67 - Scoring Domain Model
- Verified baseline: T66 pre-change baseline was 238 passing tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed; T66 completion baseline is 243 passing tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed
- Ruff: `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` pass for the full repository after T66
- Last updated: 2026-06-01
- Open findings: T34/T40 remain blocked until real pilot evidence exists; Phase 12 may use public sources for solo showcase artifacts only.
- Latest domain contract: `WorkflowKind` lives in `workflow_agent_studio/domain/workflow.py`.
- Completed product baseline: public-data working product proof for 8 public workflow fixtures; Phase 0 / local evidence-linked MVP; T58 framework positioning refresh complete; T59 design candidate schema complete; T60 diverse generation flow complete; T61 Playbook export complete; T62 permission/runtime boundary pack complete; T63 framework readiness review complete; SMB AI roadmap documentation package created and indexed at `docs/AI_ROADMAP_STUDIO_INDEX.md`; T64 privacy classification schema complete; T65 recommendation card schema complete; T66 costing schema complete

## Next Task Digest

Task: T66 - Costing Domain Model

Status: complete.

Task: T67 - Scoring Domain Model

Goal: implement priority score schemas for business value, delivery readiness,
risk penalty, priority band, confidence, rationale, and uncertainty.

Acceptance summary:

- priority band supports quick_win, strategic_pilot, prepare_first,
  do_not_automate_yet, classic_automation, and human_only
- score output requires rationale and uncertainty notes
- invalid score bands fail validation
- unit tests cover valid and invalid score outputs

File scope:

- `workflow_agent_studio/domain/scoring.py`
- `tests/unit/test_priority_scoring_schema.py`

Required context:

- `docs/methodology/scoring_model.md`

## Evaluation State

Last Evaluation:

- Task: T66
- Date: 2026-06-01
- Eval Source: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_costing_schema.py -q`
- Result: 5 passed; full repository verification passed with 243 tests

## Profile State

RAG: ON

- Current mode: text-only
- Next work: blocked until real workflow data is reviewed
- Open retrieval findings: none

Planning: ON

- Current schema: blueprint v1 plus design-candidate-v1
- Next work: RoadmapReport v1, scoring,
  and verification schemas for SMB implementation planning
- Open planning findings: none

Tool-Use: OFF

Agentic: OFF

Compliance: OFF

- Phase 14 adds privacy/security controls for roadmap planning, but the project
  still does not claim a named regulatory compliance framework.
